## 🚀 Overview

**BharatGram-DAO** is a social-impact Web3 application designed to digitize and decentralize Panchayat governance.  
The platform creates a transparent ecosystem where **citizens, Panchayat officials, and contractors** collaborate on a single trusted system.

By combining **Blockchain (Web3)** for tamper-proof public records and **AI (GenAI)** for citizen assistance, BharatGram-DAO solves key governance challenges like lack of transparency, slow grievance redressal, and limited citizen participation.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Rural development projects often face:
- ❌ Lack of transparency in project budgets and spending  
- ❌ Delayed updates and unclear project progress  
- ❌ Corruption risks due to centralized control  
- ❌ Limited citizen awareness of government schemes
